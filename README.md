# Developing AI System Tutorials: 

To achieve the task of developing an AI system to analyze astronomical images and identify potential cosmic phenomena, we can utilize computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms. Here is an outline of the code that can be used to accomplish this objective:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
```

2. Load and preprocess the astronomical image:
```python
def load_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    image = image / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
    return image

image_path = "path_to_image.jpg"  # Replace with the actual image path
image = load_image(image_path)
```

3. Load the pre-trained deep learning model:
```python
model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights="imagenet", include_top=True)
```

4. Perform object detection and classification:
```python
def detect_objects(image):
    resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
    expanded_image = np.expand_dims(resized_image, axis=0)
    preprocessed_image = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(expanded_image)

    predictions = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
    predicted_classes = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.decode_predictions(predictions, top=5)[0]

    return predicted_classes

detected_objects = detect_objects(image)
```

5. Generate a report summarizing the detected objects and their characteristics:
```python
def generate_report(detected_objects):
    report = "Detected Objects:\n\n"
    for obj in detected_objects:
        class_name = obj[1]
        confidence = obj[2] * 100
        report += f"- {class_name}: {confidence:.2f}% confidence\n"

    return report

report = generate_report(detected_objects)
print(report)
```

The above code outlines the process of developing an AI system to analyze astronomical images and identify potential cosmic phenomena. It utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model for object detection and classification. The output is a markdown report summarizing the detected objects and their characteristics.

Please note that this code is a starting point and may require further customization and optimization based on the specific requirements and dataset.

To accomplish Task 2, we can create an AI model to analyze spectroscopic data from celestial bodies and identify potential signatures of extraterrestrial life. Here's an example code that demonstrates how this can be done:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the spectroscopic data
data = pd.read_csv('spectroscopic_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('label', axis=1), data['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the testing set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Generate a report summarizing the analyzed spectra and potential indications of extraterrestrial life
report_md = f"""
# Spectroscopic Analysis Report

## Summary

The spectroscopic data from celestial bodies was analyzed using a random forest classifier. The model achieved the following results:

{report}

## Potential Indications of Extraterrestrial Life

Based on the analysis of the spectroscopic data, the following potential indications of extraterrestrial life were identified:

- [List any potential indications here]

"""

print(report_md)
```

Please note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to adapt and customize the code according to your specific requirements and the structure of your spectroscopic data. Additionally, you'll need to ensure that the data is properly preprocessed and formatted before training the model.
