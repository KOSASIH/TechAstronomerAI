# Developing AI System Tutorials: 

To achieve the task of developing an AI system to analyze astronomical images and identify potential cosmic phenomena, we can utilize computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms. Here is an outline of the code that can be used to accomplish this objective:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
```

2. Load and preprocess the astronomical image:
```python
def load_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    image = image / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
    return image

image_path = "path_to_image.jpg"  # Replace with the actual image path
image = load_image(image_path)
```

3. Load the pre-trained deep learning model:
```python
model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights="imagenet", include_top=True)
```

4. Perform object detection and classification:
```python
def detect_objects(image):
    resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
    expanded_image = np.expand_dims(resized_image, axis=0)
    preprocessed_image = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(expanded_image)

    predictions = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
    predicted_classes = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.decode_predictions(predictions, top=5)[0]

    return predicted_classes

detected_objects = detect_objects(image)
```

5. Generate a report summarizing the detected objects and their characteristics:
```python
def generate_report(detected_objects):
    report = "Detected Objects:\n\n"
    for obj in detected_objects:
        class_name = obj[1]
        confidence = obj[2] * 100
        report += f"- {class_name}: {confidence:.2f}% confidence\n"

    return report

report = generate_report(detected_objects)
print(report)
```

The above code outlines the process of developing an AI system to analyze astronomical images and identify potential cosmic phenomena. It utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model for object detection and classification. The output is a markdown report summarizing the detected objects and their characteristics.

Please note that this code is a starting point and may require further customization and optimization based on the specific requirements and dataset.

To accomplish Task 2, we can create an AI model to analyze spectroscopic data from celestial bodies and identify potential signatures of extraterrestrial life. Here's an example code that demonstrates how this can be done:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the spectroscopic data
data = pd.read_csv('spectroscopic_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('label', axis=1), data['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the testing set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Generate a report summarizing the analyzed spectra and potential indications of extraterrestrial life
report_md = f"""
# Spectroscopic Analysis Report

## Summary

{report}

## Potential Indications of Extraterrestrial Life

"""

print(report_md)
```

Please note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to adapt and customize the code according to your specific requirements and the structure of your spectroscopic data. Additionally, you'll need to ensure that the data is properly preprocessed and formatted before training the model.

To build an AI system to analyze radio signals from space and search for potential signals from intelligent civilizations, we can follow the steps below:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal as signal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

2. Load and preprocess the radio signal data:
```python
def load_radio_signal(file_path):
    # Load the radio signal data from file
    signal_data = np.loadtxt(file_path)

    # Preprocess the signal data (e.g., normalize, remove noise)

    return signal_data

file_path = "radio_signal.wav"
radio_signal = load_radio_signal(file_path)
```

3. Apply signal processing techniques to analyze the radio signal:
```python
def analyze_radio_signal(signal_data):
    # Apply signal processing techniques (e.g., Fourier transform, filtering)

    # Detect and analyze any anomalous signals

    return analyzed_signals

analyzed_signals = analyze_radio_signal(radio_signal)
```

4. Generate a report summarizing the analyzed signals:
```python
def generate_report(analyzed_signals):
    report = ""

    # Summarize the analyzed signals, including any potential candidate signals

    return report

report = generate_report(analyzed_signals)
```

5. Visualize the analyzed signals and any potential candidate signals:
```python
def visualize_signals(signal_data, analyzed_signals):
    # Plot the radio signal data

    # Mark any potential candidate signals on the plot

    plt.show()

visualize_signals(radio_signal, analyzed_signals)
```

Please note that the code provided is a template and may require modifications based on the specific requirements of your task and the format of the radio signal data.

    # Load transit light curve data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file)
    
    # Extract time and brightness values
    time = data['Time']
    brightness = data['Brightness']
    
    # Normalize brightness values
    brightness = (brightness - np.mean(brightness)) / np.std(brightness)
    
    # Apply a rolling mean to smoothen the light curve
    smoothed_brightness = pd.Series(brightness).rolling(window=10, center=True).mean()
    
    # Find the period of the transit using Lomb-Scargle periodogram
    from astropy.timeseries import LombScargle
    frequency, power = LombScargle(time, brightness).autopower()
    period = 1 / frequency[np.argmax(power)]
    
    # Detect transit events using a threshold-based approach
    transit_threshold = 3.0  # Adjust this threshold based on the data
    transit_indices = np.where(smoothed_brightness < -transit_threshold)[0]
    
    # Calculate transit duration and depth
    transit_duration = np.median(np.diff(time[transit_indices]))
    transit_depth = np.median(smoothed_brightness[transit_indices])
    
    # Identify potential habitable planet candidates based on transit duration and depth
    habitable_candidates = np.where((transit_duration > 0.5) & (transit_depth > -0.1))[0]

To analyze gravitational wave data and search for potential signals from cataclysmic events or black hole mergers, we can use the following code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.signal import find_peaks

def analyze_gravitational_wave_data(data):
    # Process the gravitational wave data
    processed_data = process_data(data)
    
    # Detect peaks in the processed data
    peaks, _ = find_peaks(processed_data, height=0)
    
    # Analyze the detected peaks
    analyzed_peaks = analyze_peaks(peaks, processed_data)
    
    return analyzed_peaks

def process_data(data):
    # Apply signal processing techniques to the data
    processed_data = your_signal_processing_function(data)
    
    return processed_data

def analyze_peaks(peaks, data):
    analyzed_peaks = []
    
    for peak in peaks:
        # Extract relevant information from the peak
        position = peak
        amplitude = data[peak]
        duration = calculate_duration(data, peak)
        
        # Classify the peak based on characteristics
        classification = classify_peak(amplitude, duration)
        
        analyzed_peaks.append({
            'position': position,
            'amplitude': amplitude,
            'duration': duration,
            'classification': classification
        })
    
    return analyzed_peaks

def calculate_duration(data, peak):
    # Calculate the duration of the peak based on the data
    duration = your_duration_calculation_function(data, peak)
    
    return duration

def classify_peak(amplitude, duration):
    # Classify the peak based on its characteristics
    if amplitude > threshold_amplitude and duration > threshold_duration:
        return 'Cataclysmic event'
    elif amplitude > threshold_amplitude:
        return 'Black hole merger'
    else:
        return 'Unknown'
```

This code defines several functions to process and analyze gravitational wave data. The `analyze_gravitational_wave_data` function is the main entry point, which takes the raw data as input and returns a list of analyzed peaks. Each peak is represented as a dictionary with the position, amplitude, duration, and classification.

You would need to replace `your_signal_processing_function`, `your_duration_calculation_function`, `threshold_amplitude`, and `threshold_duration` with appropriate implementations and values specific to your analysis.

Please note that this code is a basic template and may require further customization and optimization based on your specific requirements and data characteristics.
