# Developing AI System Tutorials: 

To achieve the task of developing an AI system to analyze astronomical images and identify potential cosmic phenomena, we can utilize computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms. Here is an outline of the code that can be used to accomplish this objective:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
```

2. Load and preprocess the astronomical image:
```python
def load_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    image = image / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
    return image

image_path = "path_to_image.jpg"  # Replace with the actual image path
image = load_image(image_path)
```

3. Load the pre-trained deep learning model:
```python
model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights="imagenet", include_top=True)
```

4. Perform object detection and classification:
```python
def detect_objects(image):
    resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
    expanded_image = np.expand_dims(resized_image, axis=0)
    preprocessed_image = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(expanded_image)

    predictions = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
    predicted_classes = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.decode_predictions(predictions, top=5)[0]

    return predicted_classes

detected_objects = detect_objects(image)
```

5. Generate a report summarizing the detected objects and their characteristics:
```python
def generate_report(detected_objects):
    report = "Detected Objects:\n\n"
    for obj in detected_objects:
        class_name = obj[1]
        confidence = obj[2] * 100
        report += f"- {class_name}: {confidence:.2f}% confidence\n"

    return report

report = generate_report(detected_objects)
print(report)
```

The above code outlines the process of developing an AI system to analyze astronomical images and identify potential cosmic phenomena. It utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model for object detection and classification. The output is a markdown report summarizing the detected objects and their characteristics.

Please note that this code is a starting point and may require further customization and optimization based on the specific requirements and dataset.
